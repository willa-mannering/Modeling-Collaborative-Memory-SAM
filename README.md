# Modeling-Collaborative-Memory-SAM
The code used to create the cSAM model in the Mannering W.M., Rajaram, S., Shiffrin, R.M. & Jones M.N. (2023) Modeling Collaborative Memory with SAM paper.

In this paper we present a framework to scale the Search of Associative Memory model (SAM; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981) to collaborative free recall paradigms with multiple models working together. Multiple SAM models recalling together naturally produce collaborative inhibition when the group members use recalls by the group as cues to retrieve from memory, strongly supporting the “retrieval disruption” hypothesis. This work shows that SAM can act as a unified theory to explain both individual and collaborative memory effects, and offers a framework for future predictions of scaling to increased group sizes, shared knowledge, and factors facilitating the spread of false memories in groups.

This repository contains the cSAM code for uncategorized lists and categorized lists as described in the paper.
